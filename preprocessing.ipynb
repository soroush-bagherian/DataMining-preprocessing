Underlying the development of novel drugs and therapies against pathogens, in treating autoimmunity and allergy, or in curing diseases such as cancer, is the vital research being undertaken to understand how the human host responds to and defends itself against these insults. The aim of this module is to provide a fundamental understanding of the cells, molecules, and genes involved in the immune and blood system, how these protect the host, but also how they can cause and contribute to disease. Students will explore key concepts in blood cell development, innate and adaptive immunity, and immune dysfunction, before considering how experimental work leads to novel treatments to improve human health. The module will also integrate key concepts with reference to research data, encouraging students to critically analyse primary research articles and explore new strategies in experimental design. This module will cover key areas underlying the study of haematology and immunology, including the development of the blood system and stem cells, defence of the body by the innate and adaptive immune system, and the contribution of adaptive immunity in directing the immune response. We will discuss key concepts in how the immune system can combat globally-important human diseases, and what happens when an inappropriate response is mounted, for example in chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and allergy.

You will be able to critically reflect on current and/or important issues and debates in the topic, be they theoretical or practical. You will also be able to reflect on and evaluate relationships between theory, research and scholarship, policy and practice, bringing research evidence to bear in informing discussion. You will show that you can access, interpret and critically evaluate the literature in the field, both in the substantive area and concerning methodological aspects. The individual study module offers you the possibility of working towards the attainment of your Programme Learning Outcomes by studying, at an academic level (i.e. research and theory, perhaps in relation to policy and/or practice) issues concerned with a topic area that is relevant to, but otherwise not represented in, your programme. It is not experiential learning and neither is it empirical enquiry. It is academic enquiry, supported by reading, reflection and critical analysis; it may however involve observations, discussions and interviews with key informants, to support your developing knowledge and understanding. For example, you might choose to study and write about issues in Physical Education; or Shakespeare in the community; or psychological perspectives on technology-enhanced learning. A successful individual study module will enhance your employability profile by developing and demonstrating your ability to propose, plan and carry out an academic study with a degree of independence, as well as by enhancing your knowledge and understanding of the substantive and methodological aspects of the field of the study. Students may propose to undertake an individual study module relevant to their programme in place of a taught Optional Module in Term 7, if they wish to undertake an academic study of a topic that is not otherwise represented in the student's programme.

      "By completing a Placement Study module, you will come to know about and understand the operation of the chosen education service or educationally-relevant activity. You will be able to critically reflect on the challenges associated with providing the service or running the activity, for example in terms of the legislative environment, or social, economic and political pressures, or conflicting imperatives. You will also be able to evaluate the relationships between theoretical (research and scholarship) perspectives and policy drivers on the service or activity and its operation in practice. You will demonstrate self-awareness regarding the contribution you made during your experience and the associated strengths and areas for development in your work. The placement study module offers you the possibility of working towards the attainment of your Programme Learning Outcomes by experiencing and reflecting on the working of an education service or education-related activity in practice. It is not a theoretical exploration of the service or activity; neither is it principally an empirical enquiry into the service or activity. Rather, it is experiential learning supported by reading, reflection and critical analysis. For example, you might consider arranging a placement study in a Higher Education Institution's policy response team, or with a publisher of children's books, or with a Local Authority's service for learners with special educational needs. The experience of arranging and carrying out work in the chosen education service or activity will enhance your employability profile, not only in general but also for the specific area (children's publishing, for example); this could help you target a particular career path. Students may propose to undertake a period of work experience relevant to their programme in an education service or education-related activity, arranged by themselves, in place of an Optional Module in Term 7 and assessed through a written report. Proposals must be submitted to the student's Programme Leader during Term 5 for approval during Term 6; the handbook gives more information.\n",
      "The proposal for a Placement Study, together with the arrangements for its establishment and conduct, will be developed by you, the student, initially under the guidance of your supervisor.

The proposal should contain a clear statement of the aims of the particular placement study proposed; the setting of the Placement Study, with contact details; the material on which the Placement Study and the written report will be based; the methods by which this material will be obtained; and a timeline for the placement and the associated private study and assessment work. Responsibility for writing the proposal and setting up the placement lies with you, the student, but the Programme Leader and module coordinator will provide support, guidance and challenge. Once the proposal has been agreed with the Programme Leader, the written approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies will be sought, normally in week 6 of Term 6 at the Undergraduate Teaching Committee Meeting, after which the proposal will be put to the Board of Studies at the end of Term 6. You will not be allowed to undertake a Placement Study or to receive credit relating to any work done during a placement until the proposal has been accepted and approved at the Board of Studies meeting in the term before the placement. The department will allocate a placement supervisor, who will be an academic member of staff in the department (this person may also be the module coordinator).\n",
      "The term education service is interpreted very broadly to refer to the delivery of any educational experiences by a group of professionals in a designated area of work, or to the work of professionals dealing with educational issues, ideas and concerns. Examples of educational services are: adult education; educational administration; educational librarianship; educational research; education and training in commerce and industry; hospital education; museum education; the prison service; the school psychological service; vocational education. It includes the work of educational professionals within, for example, further, higher and adult education; play groups, nursery schools and other EYFS settings; primary schools; secondary schools; special schools; youth and community work.\n",
      "The Placement Study is the equivalent of a term’s workload on one optional module, but the placement itself will normally last for six weeks and will normally take place in York or within easy travelling distance of York. Students may make a special case for a placement away from York, but still in the U.K., bearing in mind University residence requirements and the need to study for their other modules. The placement may involve more than one setting or venue.\n",
      "Students will need to meet the additional costs of a Placement Study themselves, for example transport costs, although it may be possible for students to link some placements with sponsorship or exchange schemes.\n",
      "A typical schedule for the work is as follows. The first week of the term will involve preparation work for the placement. During Weeks 2 to 7 you will be expected to visit your placement regularly (two days a week would be typical); your schedule should take account of your university timetable. Whilst at your placement you should keep a diary of observations, reflections etc, and probably collect documents and data, with the agreement of the hosts. Although the placement study is not principally an empirical enquiry, you may plan and/or carry out the collection of some empirical data and/or analyse such data, if this is part of the service or activity or, for example, if you are asked by the service to carry out a small scale service evaluation; this can form part of your summative assessment report. The rest of the time each week will be spent in reading, preparation, analysis and writing. However, this schedule may vary markedly from study to study. For example, the placement itself may be more concentrated or more spread out. Additional material may be collected outside term time.\n",
      "In Week 8 or 9 you will present an oral progress report about your placement study to your placement supervisor (this is formatively assessed). In addition to this meeting, you will have two other keep-in-touch meetings with your departmental placement supervisor during the course of the placement study.\n",

      "Please note the following.\n",
      "1. The Placement Study is an opportunity to investigate the issues involved in the delivery of an education service or activity. Your report thus needs to focus on the particular problems and issues faced by those professionals you have observed and spoken to. You will also need to draw upon published writings to contextualise your study and to interpret your observations and experiences.\n",
      "2. The assessment of the report will follow the standard degree class grade descriptions for your programme. Of particular importance will be the extent to which you are able to highlight key issues from your documents, data and diary and relate these to existing literature on your topic. The Module Learning Outcomes emphasise critical reflection and self-awareness.\n",

      "be familiar with the main methods used to investigate language comprehension, production and acquisition\n",
      "be able to appreciate and discuss why certain things happen, or fail to happen in language processing and language learning\n",
      "be able to evaluate the relevance of major research findings for language education Although language use and language learning always occur in social contexts, they are, essentially, mental processes. The main aim of the module is, therefore, to explore the relationship between the human mind and language. More specific aims will be:\n",
      "to understand better how language users (including language learners and bilingual speakers) process language.\n",
      "to acquaint students with methods for studying the mental processes involved in language use and language learning.\n",
      "to draw implications from research findings for how language comprehension, production and acquisition can be facilitated in educational and learning contexts. This module is most suitable for those on language-related masters (MATESOL and MAALLT), as it requires good prior knowledge of linguistics.\n",
      "The module will consist of nine sessions of two hours. Each session will combine a presentation by the tutor, small group discussions and practical activities. Students will be given preliminary and / or follow-up exercises as homework, and will be expected to read a number of papers related to the topics introduced in the class.\n",

      "Week 2 - Overview of the module. An introduction to key themes of psychology of language and language learning\n",
      "This session will start by discussing what are and are not the concerns of psychology of language and language learning. It will offer an overview of the topics that will be covered and questions that will be asked, explaining why answers to these questions are relevant to those involved in language teaching and learning.\n",
      "Week 3 - Mental representations of vocabulary and grammar\n",
      "Despite the fact that language use is one of the most natural things we do, language is a very complex system. This session explores what we know (most often below the level of consciousness) about words and rules for combining them, and how such knowledge could be represented and stored in our mind. How is our mental lexicon organised, and how do we retrieve a word from it when we need it? And do bilinguals have two lexicons or one?\n",
      "Week 4 - Reading: Visual word recognition\n",
      "As skilled readers, we recognise words in texts, and access their meaning very quickly – in fact we cannot suppress recognising a word even if we wanted to. But how does it happen? Young children cannot do it, and school children find it difficult. This session explains how children learn to read, and explores differences between skilled and unskilled readers. How do we read words: do we read every letter, or do we read words as a whole (as we might name a picture)? Do we read every word? How do our eyes move in reading, and can it tell us anything about how we read?\n",
      "Week 5 - Listening: Spoken word recognition\n",
      "Unlike reading, listening is not something that we are taught how to do. Still, the process is not any less complex than reading. Speech comes as a continuous stream of sound, so how do we know where one word ends and the next begins? What strategies do babies use to extract words they still don’t know? What is the role of prosody, and how much does our listening depend on the context? How do bilinguals recognise words of their two languages?\n",
      "Week 6 - Sentence processing and comprehension\n",
      "In this session we move onto the comprehension of individual sentences. The session explores how our mind parses (analyses) the grammatical structure of a sentence and which cues we rely on to do that.,Do all languages rely on the same cues, and what happens in second language learning when they do not?\n",
      "Week 7 - Discourse comprehension\n",
      "In this session we consider the level of discourse comprehension. How do we create a coherent mental model of what is being spoken about and how do we work out subtle relationships between what people say and what they mean? We shall introduce the notions of cohesion, context, inferences and schemata and will consider what determines individual differences in discourse comprehension skills. Some educational implications will be considered.\n",
      "Week 8 - Language production: writing\n",
      "This session turns from language comprehension to language production, with emphasis on writing. What are the main differences between speech and writing? What are the stages of writing? What are the differences between skilled and less skilled writers? How could one become a better writer?\n",
      "Week 9 - Language development\n",
      "In this session we turn to the question of how we acquire languages. What can babies hear and learn before and after birth? Is there anything they already know? How do children get from speech perception, though babbling and one word stage, to the acquisition of complex grammar? What are the main differences between first and second language learning? We consider a range of inventive psycholinguistc experiments that shed some light on these questions.\n",
      "Week 10 - Revision and assignment preparation\n",

By looking at how meaning is constructed and negotiated by speakers in concrete communicative situations, you will learn about those aspects of communication that go beyond truth-conditional (often labeled 'semantic') aspects of utterance interpretation. These include notions such as explicit and implicit meaning (the distinction between 'what is said' and 'what is meant'), conversational implicature (suggested inferences that arise as a result of co-operative behaviour), reference determination (the various ways in which our grammar allows us to talk about entities in the external world), figurative language (metaphor, irony, etc.) and information packaging (strategies of making larger chunks of language appear coherent).

Students will be introduced to the sociolinguistic context of Middle English, zoom in on the issue of language contact and possible creolisation tendencies, and will learn about the major dialect areas of Middle English. The main characteristics of Middle English orthography and phonology as well as basics of Middle English grammar and lexis will be discussed. Particular attention will here be given to language change both within the period and beyond, examining how Middle English developed out of Old English and how it differs from later stages of the language, especially Present Day English, placing Middle English in context. Finally, the reading and linguistic analysis of Middle English material will be practised, with a focus on the language of Chaucer, whose work will also form the basis of a creative writing project relating Middle English to the modern world. This should allow students to develop their skills at dealing with the specific variety of Middle English in which they are written, with the aim of becoming able to enjoy them for their quality as pieces of entertaining and enlightening literature. We will also discuss what it implies to approach Chaucer's Tales from the perspective of autonomous 21st century readers, and relate our views to other modern receptions of Chaucer (and the Middle Ages) in various media. In this module, we will examine the period of Middle English, learning both about the sociocultural background and the main linguistic features of this stage of the English language.

However, students interested in classical geometry and topology should also find plenty of interest here. This module is designed to lead on to the study of Algebraic Groups in the Spring Term. \n",

The Applied Module for Mathematics and Physics in Stage 2 aims to introduce some of the main ideas and theories of modern applied mathematics and mathematical physics, along with some of the main mathematical methods that are used to study and solve problems in these theories. Working alongside the modules provided in the Physics department, the aim is to present a mathematical viewpoint, but still in the context of applications, so that theory and technique progress in tandem. The overall aim is to lay the foundations for the further study of applied mathematics and mathematical physics in Stages 3 and 4.\n",
      "As part of these broad aims, this module has the following components:\n",
      "Classical Dynamics (Spring) presents a sophisticated form of Newton’s laws known as analytical mechanics, which also forms an important component of modern theories of both classical and quantum physics.\n",
      "Waves and Fluids (Spring/Summer), exploring the the dynamics of continuous media, focusing on elementary fluid dynamics and the motion of waves. This lays the foundations for the full development of fluid dynamics in stages 3 and 4, as well as for modules on electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. The mathematical techniques of vector calculus are employed and further developed, as are Fourier methods.\n",
      "Studying these two components alongside each other will allow students to see the many connections across different areas of Applied Mathematics; understanding these connections and being able to use ideas and techniques across many contexts is an essential part of the modern mathematician’s toolkit.

These techniques are used by many graduates in their day-to-day work. The Core modules in the second year of mathematics programmes cover material which is essential for accessing a wide range of topics later on. Such material underpins the development of mathematics across all three of the major streams we offer through our single-subject degrees, and it is also very important for many combined programmes.

Second, a powerful tool both in applied mathematics and analysis is the Fourier transform, which has applications in many areas. \n",

The mathematical theory of interest rates is complex, since on the one hand it has to cover simultaneous random behaviour of a family of bonds indexed by maturity, and on the other hand be consistent with no-arbitrage restrictions.

The complexity stems from the fact that in general interest rates depend on running time and maturity time, so are stochastic processes of two time variables, each with a very specific role.

The aim of the module is to provide programming skills required for the implementation of mathematical models in quantitative finance. The focus will be on the C++ programming language, which is widely accepted as the main tool amongst practitioners in the financial community. The implementation of a given model rarely narrows down to the pricing of a single particular financial instrument. Most often it is possible to devise general numerical schemes which can be applied to various types of derivatives. The code should be designed so that it easily integrates with the work of other developers and can be modified by other users. The student will learn such skills by writing C++ programs designed for pricing various types of derivatives, starting from the simplest discrete time models and finishing with continuous time models based on finite difference or Monte Carlo methods. nan Numerical & Computing Techniques in Finance (Online Version)  Discrete Time Modelling & Derivative Securities (Online Version)  \n",

It provides methods for calculating the position, velocity, acceleration and other properties of the motion of point particles and extended bodies as function of time, if the forces acting are known. Classical mechanics is an important subject in its own right but it also forms the basis of several other branches of physical science; indeed many of the ideas incorporated in quantum theory have their origin in classical mechanics. This module commences with the study of translational motion in systems containing one or few particles. It then deals with rotational motion. Some of the central concepts of physics – such as momentum, force, energy, work, angular momentum and key conservation laws will be introduced.

The most difficult aspect of programming is designing a step-by- step recipe (algorithm) to solve a given problem. This kind of logical problem solving is a useful skill which is highly valued in research and in the commercial world, and which all physicists should learn through practice. Once an algorithm has been designed, it must be implemented in a programming language, which for this course is Python. Python is a modern language which is freely available for Windows, Linux/Unix and Mac OS with extensive documentation, tutorials and extensions available online. It is easy to learn but very powerful, and is increasingly being used commercially and in scientific research. Students will learn how to create programs in the Python language to solve physics problems and then visualise the results in 2D and 3D. The emphasis is on problem solving, and teaching skills which students can then apply to other areas of their study. \n",

Simpler problems can sometimes be solved analytically but, more normally, problems of interest require numerical solution. For the solution of such simulations to have meaning, results must replicate accurately the outcome of a real physical experiment or process. The main aims of the first part of this module are to introduce (i) the general properties of partial differential equations and (ii) the finite difference method for the solution of partial differential equations.

Computational physics is the third way of studying physics and is in addition to (and complementary with) theoretical and experimental physics. Computer programs model the real world using theoretical ideas cast into mathematical form and then converted into an algorithm. This algorithm is expressed in a high level programming language, and this is then run on the computer. The analysis and development of the results is closely akin to experiment, in that input (independent) quantities may be varied and the change in the output (dependent) quantities are found. Hence a simulation is the representation of an individual experiment, and may be used to give a prediction of the results of that experiment, if the model is accurate. Such simulation may be considerably easier /quicker / cheaper to perform than the equivalent experiment, and may also yield fresh insight and understanding into the results of the experiment. That is why computational physics has become essential to many modern research fields. The techniques of computational physics embrace model design, numerical analysis, computer programming and experimentation. This laboratory is designed to help you to develop these essential skills. nan Computational Laboratory  Laboratory for Theoretical Physics  \n",

By deriving expressions for curl, div, grad in different coordinate systems and relating these to physical examples the laws of Gauss, Ampère and Faraday are expressed mathematically in both their macrophysical and differential forms.

      "Building on Mathematics I in stage 1, this module is strongly aligned with stage 2 physics modules and provides the mathematical skills required to fully address their physics content. The module describes the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations used in quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and thermodynamics, emphasising their application to physical situations such as wave motion, thermal conduction, and the solution of the time dependent Schrödinger equation. The Fourier series is used to provide the mathematics required to interpret the periodic functions generated. A development of these mathematical ideas allows non-periodic functions to be analysed, using the Fourier transform. This has applications throughout physics, in evaluating signals, and in diffraction theory. The module also introduces the Frobenius method which can be applied to solve 2nd order differential equations in which coefficients are also functions of the independent variable.

Your knowledge of the underlying fundamental physics, ability to create simple models and apply theories, and experience with solving quantifiable problems will be used to explore some of the most interesting aspects of stellar evolution, stellar structure, and nucleosynthesis. There is a balance between physics and astrophysics throughout this module. This module allows you to take all the physics and mathematical skills and knowledge you have acquired in the previous years and apply them to practical physical systems - typically stars. You will begin from a simple perspective to solve practical problems and, as needed, apply more rigorous physical models to find solutions. For example, you can calculate from a simple model and basic physics what the interior temperature of the Sun should be to fuse two protons if these protons fused when they were in contact at about 1 femtometre. You could then check the answer with your intuition, realise it is wrong, and improve it with a semiclassical calculation using the deBroglie wavelength. Finally, the physics and mathematics of sub-barrier fusion will be correctly applied to more fully understand stellar fusion and energy generation.\n",

Students gain invaluable professional experience of working in the field, and gain an insight into some of the constraints, challenges and opportunities that exist when working for such an organisation. Students are encouraged to reflect on the theoretical content of the programme as a whole, and critically evaluate it against their experience on the ground. They should think critically about how their organisation both reflects and addresses the significant political, ethical, logistical, and methodological challenges to post-war recovery.   Students will use the research skills they have learned and practiced throughout the course of the programme to conduct research for an original dissertation which combines primary and secondary research methods to investigate a theme relevant to post-war recovery. A significant proportion of the primary research should be collected during their work placement, whether while working for the organisation in question or in their own free time. This will depend on arrangements made with the host organisation. There should be a clear connection between the work placement and the dissertation, whether by virtue of the theme analysed or the case study chosen. This will allow them to produce a sophisticated, in-depth analysis which brings together the theory and practice of post-war recovery. Dissertations should demonstrate critical thinking skills, methodological rigour, both theoretical and empirical understanding, and the ability to make a structured, evidenced argument. nan Policy Report (PCS Placement)  The Practice of Fieldwork  \n",

You will develop an understanding of how discussion of courts and court processes reflect wider social, historical and economic concerns and an understanding of some of the political issues that influence debates about courts and court processes. You will gain a greater sense of how courts do or do not offer reliable and appropriate solutions and outcomes to legal disputes and the key arguments for alternatives to current English and Welsh civil and criminal justice systems. This will involve developing fuller knowledge of alternatives processes, alternative dispute resolution and legal practices in other jurisdictions. These perspectives will help you develop your understanding in the subject areas you look at in Foundations of Law modules (as well as concepts explored during Skills modules and Professionalism and Ethics) by thinking about ways rules, skills and ethics are practiced during 'litigation'. By the end of the module you will therefore be able to engage in a critical discussion about courts and court processes that will provide you with greater criticality in other areas of your legal studies. This module will give you an opportunity to explore how rules of law and legal values are actually applied through court processes and therefore to think critically about the difficult relationship between 'law in books' and 'law in action.' We will look at civil and criminal justice systems in a wide sense and examine issues such as access to justice, fair and accurate adjudication, open justice, alternatives to court processes etc. Our approach will be critical and evaluative and will be particularly interested in exploring the question of what we mean by a system of 'justice' whether our ideas of what a justice system should by trying to achieve are problematic.

Students will therefore develop their ability to understand and evaluate law in particular ways and enhance their sense of the interdisciplinary nature of legal study. The subject matter is intended to enhance student understanding of key areas of the LLB curriculum as well as further developing their ability to engage in legal and academic discussion by drawing on a range of sources and using them in critical evaluative discussion. This module will explore the ways in which law is a dynamic and developing field of human activity and how what 'the law' at any given point in time (like now) is in fact the result of change both 'inside' the law as well as the result of interactions with wider social, political, economic and cultural influences. By exploring the development of some key areas of law, we will identify how what we think of a settled and agreed legal principles are in fact the result of accidents and incidents of history. By the end of the module, you will therefore not only have a deeper understanding of where some of our key legal rules, principles and institutions have come from but you will also have developed a wider and more deeply critical perspective of legal rules that will help you to engage critically and insightfully during your future legal studies. The module is delivered through workshops, in which we will explore the history of particular areas areas of law (criminal trials, the development of property concepts, etc) as well as coming to understand the variety of ways that we can look at law from historical perspectives (such as the importance of particular judges, the impact of social and economic change on legal rules, the evolution of legal practices and assumptions, etc). These workshops are intended to be interactive and to involve animated discussion of both law and those wider historical perspectives.\n",

The law and practice of human rights currently faces a key challenge: although there is a proliferation of treaties, adjudicative bodies, campaigning, activism, and research in this area, serious human rights abuses persist around the world. This module aims to introduce students to a range of contemporary human rights issues with global dimensions.  In doing so, there are several core themes that students will be encouraged to consider, such as:  the doctrinal scope and limits of the law the practical and legal challenges that arise in pursuing the prevention of abuses and protection of rights the ways that political and other forms of power interact with law at different times and in different circumstances, sometimes aiding and sometimes hampering the extent to which laws are given effect the ways that human rights activism plays a role in human rights protection and the risks that can accompany activism the ways that law and politics of human rights has changed over time, and what changes may lie ahead.  The balance of plenaries (14 x 1-hour) and seminars (8 x 2-hour) is designed to enable human rights practice to be brought into the module, including through plenaries, and to reflectively develop academic and legal skills in a way that provides a strong base for pursuing any area of law in Year 3 modules.

How is the law used to practical effect in commercial and financial transactions?  This module provides an introduction to the way in which core principles of law are applied to agree parties’ rights and obligations, and protect their interests, in their commercial and financial dealings.  Students will analyse and apply elements of foundation subjects such as obligations and property “in action” in a range of common commercial and financial transactions.  Concepts such as risk and security will be considered, and students will analyse how these are dealt with in transactions.  Students will also be introduced to new areas, such as insolvency and tax which have a major influence on commercial and financial transactions.  Student activity will be varied and practical, and centred around a number of realistic, practical case studies, based around commercial and financial scenarios, and the related transactional documentation.  Activities will combine PBL, simulations, document analysis and drafting skills, negotiation, and research tasks.

      "This module provides an introduction to some key issues in legal philosophy, and demonstrates their relevance by applying them in a range of relevant contexts. How should the law address 'tragic choices', such as the decision to shoot down a hijacked passenger aircraft being used to target a densely populated city? What are the key characteristics of 'law'? Does it have to be morally good to count as law, and what are the implications, for example, for the status of law under unjust regimes? (How) is law binding? Could you, for example, refuse to obey a law which required you to perform military service? What do judges do, and what should they do? How should judges make decisions in politically or socially controversial areas, from ownership of the family home to leaving the European Union? And, is law really a mechanism for good, or is it in fact part of the problem, sustaining inequality and keeping people 'in their place'?\n",

      "(4) To develop a critical understanding of the role of public interest judicial review in the constitution, good government, and activism Public interest judicial review is a growing field in which many students are considering trying to build a career. However, this area of law and practice, and the skills required to work in it, are rarely taught systematically. This module would be the first of its kind in the UK and give YLS students real practical insight into how the law can be used to challenge unlawful government policies and practices. This module places students in the position of strategic public law litigators and human rights investigators. Working with external civil society organisations as clients, students will investigate, in groups, how a potentially unlawful government policy or practice is operating in the UK. They will compile and assess the evidence base (which will be passed on to a external client organisation), before undertaking an analysis of the potential public law and human rights arguments that could be made. The course will therefore simulate for students how complex public interest litigation is developed.\n",
      "The module will have two interwoven tracks:\n",
      "Track 1 (Knowledge and Context): Through a series of interactive lectures, the students will learn the essentials of judicial review procedure and principles. This will be taught by reference to both academic literature and empirical data on how the process works. For this element of the course, students will be working in their groups and focus on just one example of a public interest judicial review case. By way of example, the first run of this module is likely to assign cases relating to: police facial recognition; the right to rent; and climate change. Students will then be asked, as part of the interactive lectures, to reflect on and research their case in depth by reference to the topics of each lecture. The cases will be discussed as part of the lectures. The aim here is for the students to develop an applied appreciation of the substantive course content and develop a great understanding of how litigation is a much wider practice than judgments reveal. The lectures will cover the following key areas:\n",
      "Introduction/strategic use of law/legal mobilisation\n",
      "Decision-making and policymaking structures in government\n",
      "Applications/costs/permission\n",
      "Evidence: how its used in courts\n",
      "Evidence: techniques\n",
      "Impact, remedies, alternatives\n",
      "Track 2 (Application): For the second track of the course, the student will also be in the same group and be given a very short brief/topic by an external organisation interested in exploring an issue for litigation. This organisation is likely to be a legal charity, such as the Child Poverty Action Group, and will change each year. The students will treat the organisation as a client and will conduct their research in the YLS Law Clinic. The first part of the term will be spent with the groups gathering evidence on this topic under the supervision of the Clinic. For the second part of the term, students will be required to complete a template which invites them to set out their evidence on the topic and produce an analysis of the quality of the evidence. This material will be subject to a 1hr group viva in the Clinic, to simulate a meeting with counsel. If the work is of a good enough standard, the material produced by the students will be supplied to the partner organisation as a report. The remainder of the term will be spent with the students developing a legal analysis of the issue they have gathered evidence on and producing their view on the prospects of public interest litigation. Students will work in groups but produce their work individually. Public Interest Litigation Lab  Foundations in Law II  \n",

      "By the end of the module students should be able to demonstrate:\n",
      "An awareness and understanding of common structures for wealth management and distribution using trusts formed under English law and trusts formed under the laws of so-called off-shore jurisdictions;\n",
      "An awareness and understanding of how trusts are used in asset management and corporate finance;\n",
      "The ability to evaluate and manipulate concepts of trust law for diverse purposes;\n",
      "A critical engagement with, and evaluation of, trust theory in the light of examining the sample trusts, and in particular a practical and theoretical appreciation of the flexibility of the trust concept. This module builds on the Foundations in Law modules you have taken in your first and second years (or, if you are a Senior Status Student, in your first year), and particularly on the property law aspects of those modules. Please note, the module catalogue only allows one set of pre-requisite subjects to be entered, so I have entered the pre-requisites for the LLB, that is, the first year and second year Foundations in Law courses.  In the case of Senior Status students, the only pre-requisites are the first year Foundations in Law papers.\n",
      "So, what about the course?  Using precedents and transactional documents generously supplied by various leading law firms, the module will examine in much greater depth various representative uses of trusts in the modern world, from wealth management to corporate finance. It will examine how practising lawyers both work within and develop legal doctrine to achieve their clients goals. Finally it will explore the broad theoretical implications of this practice.\n",
      "Why take this module? As well as learning much more about how trusts are used in real life, there are clear links to legal practice in commerce, finance and wealth management, both in this country and abroad. In addition, the module will provide a useful theoretical overview of trusts. It also has generic value as a good introduction to how lawyers in practice use, adapt and modify the legal institutions they inherit and so create new structures for future use. This is a vitally important process that occurs in many areas.\n",
      "The course will be taught by a mixture of classes and through an inductive approach. The principal form of teaching on the module will be a series of weekly workshops. In the week prior to the workshop the relevant sample trust instrument(s) will be released to the students together with questions relating to it. One group of students will present on the trust in response to the questions. There will then be a full group debate. Following the workshop there will be a discussion session which will wrap up the debate from the preceding workshop and provide some guidance for the next workshop. The module will end with a formal plenary drawing together the overarching themes from the workshops. A module that allows you to see, analyse and critique real world uses of trusts.

      "Demonstrate and evaluate the effective use of a range of criminal advocacy skills in criminal trials of moderate complexity;\n",
      "Describe, apply and evaluate the use of a variety of case analysis techniques and theories in order to prove a criminal trial of moderate complexity;\n",
      "Evaluate the theory and application of rules and principles of specific areas of criminal evidence and apply them to criminal trials of moderate complexity;\n",
      "Apply the rules of criminal trial procedure to cases of moderate complexity and evaluate the theories and values that underpin them. The module aims to explore the ways the criminal courts deal with the process of proving of criminal offences. By identifying key rules of criminal evidence students will have opportunities to explore key evidential concepts and processes such as relevance, proof, prejudice and weight and to examine them through application of evidential rules and procedures. This is done through a combination of case simulations, in which students practice the use of relevant forensic skills, and seminar discussions, in which concepts and practices are evaluated. The module is therefore intended to provide students with a conceptual understanding of the criminal trial and its controversies through a combination experiential learning and theoretical and evaluative discussion. Students will develop their analytical and presentation skills as well as being expected to further develop their skills of research and argumentation. This module provides students with an opportunity to explore the criminal trial process through two simulations in which students will develop and reflect upon their advocacy skills, particularly the examination and cross-examination of witnesses and the making of legal submissions. Through these simulations students will also consider and evaluate core concepts of evidence and the theories of proof and persuasion as applied within the criminal legal context.\n",
      "The module will consist of workshops in which students will undertake the analysis and proof of two criminal cases (one as a team of prosecutors and one as a team of defendants). The workshops will be supplemented by subsequent seminars in which students will evaluate the theories and concepts encountered and applied in the workshops. Students will be expected to undertake a number of advocacy activities during the course of these sessions.\n",
      "There will be trial activities which students will put into practice during workshops. In each trial students will receive case papers which they will analyse as part of their trial preparation. Each case will then proceed to trial and students will take particular roles in the proving or disproving of the case against the defendant. The cases will require understanding (and application) of rules of evidence the making of legal argument in relation to those rules and the incorporation of them into the tactics and process of proof.\n",
      "Seminars involve the exploration and evaluation of evidential concepts such as hearsay, character evidence, confessions, inferences from silence and identification evidence as well as core theories of criminal evidence such as relevance, proof, weight and prejudice. Workshops will also involve consideration of underlying proof concepts and varying ideas and theories of proof, case analysis and persuasion. Students will also consider and evaluate key aspects of criminal trial processes such as legal representation, examination of witnesses and the tactical and legal burden on defendants to give evidence.\n",

This flexibility (or optionality) is very similar to the flexibility provided by derivative (financial) securities, such as options.\n",

Students choose to tell stories in fiction, non-fiction (documentary) or experimental forms.  But whatever type of film you make, you’ll learn much more about the skills, creativity and critical thinking required in an industry that’s constantly evolving.  This is a challenging module. Developing, writing, filming and finishing a film is hard work.  It’s a test of stamina and nerve, as well as of your creativity and craft.
